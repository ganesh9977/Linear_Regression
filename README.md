# Linear_Regression
## project title : predict the heart attack disease for organisation WHO. using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner
## Problem Statement:
World heard organization estimated 12 millions Dead records. One of them half of the dead result is found in US. The research scsholer point out the most relevent risk factor of heartattack as a data science engineer predict the overall risk using machine learning algorithm is called logistic regression
## TASK:
1.import the libraries which is the required for prediction

2.import the dataset your using workspace.

3.use the appropriate argument of sklearn library to train,test and split the dataset

4.fit your values with arange function using future scaling

5.check your model accuracy and precision using confuser matrix

### Conclusion:
According to the model analysis the logisticregression algorithm work successfully with 0.6 accuracy shows that building the model is successful
